QUANTUM CHILDREN — BASELINE SNAPSHOT
=====================================
Captured: 2026-02-11 ~3:50 PM MT
Purpose: Compare against future performance after cooldown + immune system fixes

ACCOUNT: ATLAS (212000584)
  Balance:     $298,246.12
  Equity:      $298,246.02
  Unrealized:  -$0.10
  Free Margin: $297,810.81

OPEN POSITIONS AT SNAPSHOT TIME:
  1. BTCUSD BUY  0.01 lot @ 67,470.77 | SL: 67,398.00 | TP: 67,676.60 | P/L: +$0.19
  2. ETHUSD BUY  0.10 lot @ 1,957.14  | SL: 1,937.21  | TP: 2,017.21  | P/L: -$0.59

NOTE: ETH is now trading at 0.1 lot with $2 risk (per-symbol override working)

TODAY'S CLOSED TRADES (from history preview):
  - Multiple SL hits on XAUUSD and BTCUSD (rapid-fire entries, no cooldown)
  - Losses ranging from -$0.68 to -$1.77 per trade
  - One TP hit: XAUUSD +$2.34
  - Pattern: overtrading without cooldown, selling into uptrend

CHANGES DEPLOYED BUT NOT YET ACTIVE (need BRAIN_ATLAS restart):
  1. Loss cooldown: 15-minute pause after SL hit per symbol
  2. ETH $2 risk override: ACTIVE (already picked up)
  3. Lot cap bug fix: ACTIVE (removed hardcoded 0.05 cap)
  4. Toxoplasma DD protection: in code, needs restart
  5. quantum_server.py: restored from 01_Systems/ (was 0 bytes at root)

CHANGES ACTIVE:
  - VDJ immune memory (27 memory cells: 9 BTC + 9 ETH + 9 XAU)
  - CRISPR-Cas9 (36 spacers: 12 per symbol)
  - Protective Deletion (toxic pattern suppression)
  - Per-symbol risk overrides (ETHUSD = $2.00)

STILL NEEDED:
  - quantum_server.py running for fresh TEQA/QNIF signals
  - BRAIN_ATLAS restart to activate loss cooldown
  - 7+ files uncommitted in git (Toxoplasma DD, config_loader, cooldown, etc.)

GIT STATUS (pushed to origin/main):
  64f8dc3  Add Pattern Energy quantum state detection display module
  68d98ea  Add Auger electron cancer treatment simulation
  27d8f40  Fix code integrity issues across 6 files
  ade48bc  Add VDJ seed antibody injection + CRISPR breach analysis
  e1e2803  Wire CRISPR-Cas9 and Protective Deletion feedback loops
  51ce90b  Fix VDJ immune memory

VPS MIGRATION PLAN (next session):
  - Move trading system to VPS for 24/7 uptime
  - Eliminates risk of local fan failure / hardware issues
  - MASTER_LAUNCH.py ready for one-command deployment
  - All 7 accounts can run simultaneously on VPS
