## WHAT WE DID THIS SESSION

### 1. TEQA v3.0 Live Runner - Fixed and Verified

**Task:** Get `teqa_live.py` working with real MT5 data.

**Problem:** `build_signal_json()` in `teqa_live.py` had field name mismatches between the v2.0-style output keys and v3.0's `fuse_results()` output.

**Fix (teqa_live.py, lines 135-137):**
```
OLD (broken):                          NEW (working):
measurement_entropy          ->        shannon_entropy
n_states                     ->        n_unique_states
n_active_qubits (missing)    ->        33 (hardcoded: 25 genome + 8 neural)
```

**Verification:** Successfully ran:
```
python teqa_live.py --symbol BTCUSD --account ATLAS --once
```

**Result:**
- Fetched 256 bars BTCUSD M1 from Atlas (account 212000584)
- Price range: $68,729 - $69,637
- Signal: SHORT @ 52.1% confidence
- Neural consensus: 100% (6 SHORT, 1 NEUTRAL, 7 neurons)
- All gates PASS (G7-G10)
- 15 active TEs, 5,102 quantum states, 9.3s execution
- Fresh `te_quantum_signal.json` written (version TEQA-3.0-NEURAL-TE)

### 2. Pushed to GitHub

**Commit:** `5e7b159` pushed to `origin/main`
```
Add TEQA pipeline: transposable element quantum algorithm + neural mutation lab
```

This commit includes the full TEQA v3.0 pipeline:
- `teqa_v3_neural_te.py` - 33-qubit split quantum engine (25 genome + 8 neural)
- `teqa_bridge.py` - signal reader for BRAIN scripts
- `teqa_live.py` - live MT5 data feeder (with the fix above)
- `mushroom_rabies_lab.py` - neural mutation lab
- `TransposableEdge.mqh` / `JardinesGate_v3.mqh` - MQL5 bridges
- 3 mutant expert models
- All 5 BRAIN scripts wired to TEQA signal

### 3. Deleted `__pycache__.zip`

Removed a 382KB zip of the `__pycache__` directory that had accumulated (contained stale .pyc files and a copy of te_quantum_signal.json). Harmless, just cleanup.

### 4. Reviewed DISTRIBUTION Folder

Read through the entire `QuantumChildren-github/DISTRIBUTION/` package:
- Client: `quantum_trader.py`, `entropy_collector.py`, simulated challenges, config
- Server: Flask collection server on :8888, SQLite backend, cyberpunk landing page
- Ready for GitHub distribution (free system, users send anonymized signals back)

## CURRENT STATE OF KEY SYSTEMS

### Git Status (QuantumTradingLibrary)
- **Branch:** main
- **Remote:** Up to date with origin/main (commit 5e7b159)
- **Working tree:** Many unstaged changes from prior sessions (100+ files)
  - These are accumulated work, NOT from this session
  - Our teqa_live.py fix is already committed and pushed

### MT5 Connection
- **Atlas (212000584):** Running, connected via MCP
- **Balance:** $298,629.23
- **Equity:** $298,356.07
- **Floating P/L:** -$273.16

### TEQA Pipeline Status
- `teqa_v3_neural_te.py` - Working (33-qubit split architecture)
- `teqa_live.py` - Working (fixed this session)
- `teqa_bridge.py` - Exists, reads signal JSON for BRAIN scripts
- `te_quantum_signal.json` - Fresh (2026-02-07T16:49:28, v3.0)
- `mushroom_rabies_lab.py` - Exists (neural mutation lab)

### Key Output File
```
te_quantum_signal.json (last written 2026-02-07T16:49:28)
  version: TEQA-3.0-NEURAL-TE
  direction: SHORT (-1)
  confidence: 0.521
  shock: CALM (0.63)
  consensus: 100% (6 SHORT, 1 NEUTRAL)
  gates: ALL PASS
```

## OPEN QUESTIONS / FOLLOW-UP

### "Folder for putting stuff in"
Jim mentioned a folder being built for organizing/distributing content. Candidates:
- `QuantumChildren-github/DISTRIBUTION/` - Client+server package for GitHub release
- `QuantumChildren-github/` - Curated public repo (has CLAUDE.md, build guides)
- `QuantumTradingLibrary-github/` - Minimal, mostly placeholder
- `CASCADE_FREE_SYSTEM/` - Separate free system (MIT license, quantum cascade)

**Next Claude session should ask Jim which folder he means and what he wants organized into it.**

### Unstaged Changes
There are 100+ unstaged/untracked files in QuantumTradingLibrary. These are from multiple prior sessions. Jim should decide what to commit vs. gitignore. Key categories:
- `.venv311/`, `rocm_env/` - Should be in .gitignore
- `*.json` simulation results (quantum_v2_sim_*) - Probably gitignore
- `*.db` files (etare_*.db, teqa_domestication.db) - Probably gitignore
- New scripts (credential_manager.py, prelaunch_validator.py, etc.) - Should commit
- MQL5 files in various Deploy folders - Should commit

### DISTRIBUTION Package
The `QuantumChildren-github/DISTRIBUTION/` folder is ready for GitHub release but has not been pushed yet. The collection server at `http://203.161.61.61:8888` is the data aggregation endpoint.

## FILE MAP (Key Files Modified/Created This Session)

| File | Action | Status |
|------|--------|--------|
| `teqa_live.py` | Fixed field names (3 lines) | Committed + Pushed |
| `te_quantum_signal.json` | Regenerated by live run | Not tracked (output file) |
| `__pycache__.zip` | Deleted | Gone |
| `teqa_analytics/report_*.txt` | Generated by TEQA run | Untracked |

---

## HOW TO RESUME

### To run TEQA live again:
```bash
cd C:\Users\jimjj\Music\QuantumChildren\QuantumTradingLibrary
python teqa_live.py --symbol BTCUSD --account ATLAS --once
```

### To run TEQA in continuous mode (60s intervals):
```bash
python teqa_live.py --symbol BTCUSD --account ATLAS
```

### To check MT5 status via MCP:
Use `mt5_connect` with account_key `ATLAS`, then `mt5_summary` or `mt5_positions`.
