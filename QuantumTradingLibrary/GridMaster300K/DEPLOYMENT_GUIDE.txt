INSTALLATION
------------

1. COPY FILES TO MT5:

   Copy the .mq5 and .mqh files to:
   C:\Users\[USERNAME]\AppData\Roaming\MetaQuotes\Terminal\[TERMINAL_ID]\MQL5\Experts\GridMaster300K\

   Make sure GridCore.mqh is in the same folder as the .mq5 files.

2. COMPILE IN METAEDITOR:

   Open MetaEditor (F4 from MT5)
   Open each .mq5 file and press F7 to compile

   5. GridMaster_Orchestrator.mq5

3. ATTACH TO CHART:

   Option A - Use Orchestrator (Recommended):

================================================================================

HOW IT WORKS
------------

1. REGIME DETECTION:
   Each expert calculates regime confidence using EMAs (8, 21, 200)
   - BULLISH: Price > EMA200, Fast > Slow, Slow > EMA200
   - BEARISH: Price < EMA200, Fast < Slow, Slow < EMA200
   - NEUTRAL: Price near EMA200, EMAs converging

2. COMPRESSION FILTER:
   Each expert has +12 compression boost added to confidence
   Only trades when confidence >= 80%
   This prevents trading in uncertain conditions

3. GRID PLACEMENT:
   - BEARISH: Opens SELL grid as price rises (better entries)
   - BULLISH: Opens BUY grid as price drops (better entries)
   - NEUTRAL: Opens BUY in lower range, SELL in upper range

4. HIDDEN SL/TP:
   - SL/TP not sent to broker (hidden from market)
   - Calculated dynamically: SL = 1.5x ATR, TP = 3x ATR
   - Managed internally - closed by market order when hit

5. PARTIAL TAKE PROFIT:
   - Close 50% of position at 1.5x ATR profit
   - Let remaining 50% run to full 3x ATR target

6. BREAK-EVEN + TRAILING:
   - Move SL to entry when 50% of TP distance reached
   - Trail at 1x ATR once BE is set

PROP FIRM CHALLENGE NOTES
-------------------------

For a $300K account with ~$2500 payout on pass:

1. TARGET CALCULATION:
   - 10% profit target = $30,000
   - With 3:1 R:R and 0.15% risk per grid
   - Approx 200 winning grid levels to reach target
   - Or fewer larger moves captured by trailing stops

2. CONSERVATIVE APPROACH ("Handcuffed"):
   - Low risk per trade (0.15%)
   - Hidden orders for discretion
   - High confidence threshold (80%)
   - Multiple confirmation via compression boost

3. DAILY TRADING:
   - System runs automatically
   - Check drawdown levels daily
   - Review regime detection accuracy
   - Adjust compression boost if needed

================================================================================

TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------

1. "Failed to create indicator handles"
   - Ensure symbol has enough history data
   - Check if symbol is tradeable

2. Orders not opening:
   - Check confidence level in logs
   - Verify regime detection is working
   - Check drawdown limits not exceeded

3. Hidden SL/TP not triggering:
   - EA must be running continuously
   - Check tick processing in logs

4. Grid not expanding:
   - Verify price has moved 0.5x ATR
   - Check order limits not reached

================================================================================

MONITORING
----------

The EA prints detailed logs:

- "GRID ORDER: SELL @ [price] | Hidden SL: [sl] | Hidden TP: [tp]"
- "PARTIAL TP: Closed [lots] lots from ticket [id]"
- "BREAK-EVEN: Moved virtual SL to entry"
- "TRAILING: Updated virtual SL to [price]"
- "HIDDEN SL HIT: Closing position [id]"

Watch the Experts tab in MT5 for real-time status.
