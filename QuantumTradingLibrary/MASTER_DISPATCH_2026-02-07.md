# MASTER DISPATCH - February 9, 2026 Evening

**Created:** 2026-02-09 ~evening MST
**Created by:** Gemini Agent (entangled with system)
**Purpose:** Centralized tracking for Bio-Quantum Synthesis (QNIF)

## SESSION #1 — QNIF / Quantum Neural-Immune Fusion

**Status:** RUNNING (BTCUSD on ATLAS and QNIF_FTMO)

**What was accomplished:**
- **QNIF Core Built:** Integrated ETARE (Compression), TEQA v3 (Neural Mosaic), and Algorithm VDJ (Immune System).
- **5-Layer Architecture:** implemented Skin (Filter), Genome (Sensing), Brain (Consensus), Immune (Adaptation), and Gate (Execution).
- **"91.2% Energy" Logic:** Extracts quantum state amplitude squared to boost confidence during high-energy anomalies.
- **"Head Start" Darwinism:** Modified ETARE Origin trainer to give losers massive mutations and fitness subsidies ("Hares") to prevent local minima.
- **Quantum Radar UI:** Built `website/quantum_radar.html` to visualize TE energy source jumps.
- **Live Deployment:** Running on Atlas and a dedicated FTMO-Demo2 account (1521096288).
- **Massive GPU Trainer:** Primed for XAUUSD/XAGUSD training across 16-worker pool.

**Next directive:**
- Monitor `vdj_memory_cells.db` population.
- Complete the "Precious Metals Bio-Trainer" once MT5 history is downloaded.
- Compare QNIF performance vs legacy TEQA/LSTM bridge.

## CROSS-SESSION DEPENDENCIES

| From | To | Dependency |
|------|----|-----------|
| QNIF | Hub | QNIF is now the primary integration target. |
| QNIF | ETARE | Uses `ETARE_Origin_Train.py` for global gene pool seeding. |
| QNIF | VDJ | `vdj_memory_cells.db` is the central "Immune Memory" for all accounts. |
