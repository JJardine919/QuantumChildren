TransposRole in Speciation and Evolutionary Novelty
Reproductive Isolation: TEs can cause postzygotic isolation, a key step in saltational speciation. Incompatible TE movements between hybrids can create sterile offspring, resulting in an abrupt separation of species.
Exaptation and Novelty: TEs can be "domesticated" or "exapted" (co-opted) by the host genome to perform new, beneficial functions suddenly. For example, TEs can contribute to the creation of new gene regulatory systems or even entire genes, as seen in the development of the vertebrate immune system and placental development in mammals.
Chromosomal Speciation: TEs play a role in saltational, abrupt speciation by promoting large-scale chromosomal rearrangements (e.g., karyotypic fission or fusion) that reproductively isolate populations immediately.

Key Concepts Linking TEs to Saltationism
"Hopeful Monsters": The concept of sudden speciation, coined by Richard Goldschmidt, is supported by the idea that TEs can create large, sudden mutations that, while usually deleterious, can occasionally lead to new, adaptive forms (hopeful monsters).
Horizontal Transfers: TEs can be transferred between species, bringing in large amounts of new genetic material that can immediately introduce novel traits.

In summary, transposable elements are the "molecular agents" of saltationism, capable of providing the rapid, large-scale, and discontinuous genetic variations that allow for the sudden, rapid evolution envisioned by saltationists.
