FILING DETAILS
=================================================

Where to file:
  USPTO TEAS Plus: https://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/apply
  Cost: $250 per class (TEAS Plus) or $350 per class (TEAS Standard)

Recommended initial filing:
  - "Quantum Children" in Class 9 + Class 42 = $500
  - Add Class 36 + 41 later if needed = +$500

Total for full coverage (all 5 marks x 4 classes):
  - Maximum: 5 marks x 4 classes x $250 = $5,000
  - Minimum viable: 1 mark x 2 classes = $500

Specimen of use:
  - Screenshot of quantum-children.com
  - Screenshot of Zenodo publication page
  - Screenshot of GitHub repository
  - Screenshot of software running (TEQA output)

Prior art / evidence of first use:
  - Zenodo DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.18526575 (published 2026-02-08)
  - Website: https://quantum-children.com
  - GitHub repository with commit history
  - ORCID: 0009-0004-9073-7192

=================================================
NOTES
=================================================

- File "Quantum Children" FIRST — it's the strongest mark
- "Artificial Organism Intelligence" is the big play —
  it names an entire paradigm
- AOI acronym should be filed with the full phrase
- TEAS Plus is cheaper but requires picking from
  pre-approved descriptions
- TEAS Standard lets you write custom descriptions
  (better for novel technology)
- You have 6 months after filing to submit specimen of use
  if filing intent-to-use
